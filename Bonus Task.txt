## Bonus task
What other information can you collect that is helpful to the user and allow them to make a more informed decision when choosing a survey.

1.Categories
When browsing a site, it could be handy to label what surveys are going to be about. This way people who have a lot of opinions about cars
can easily find them and possible be able to search for them rather than having to click on a survey invest some time into it only to realise
that they are not interested.

2.Demographic 
Before a user clicks onto a survey it might be useful to say what type of person you would like to fill this out. This would be good for both
users and business as they would be getting information from the person they would like as well as users are more likely to have opinions
on things that relate to them. 
Types of demographic could be: Age, Gender, Location, Ethnicity, Marital status and so on...

3.Completion rate
This would be more in relation to longer surveys, if there is a very low completion rate to a survey people who might have the time 
might think twice before completing after seeing that most people did not finish it. This could be down to complicated questions,
spelling mistakes, or inappropriate questions.
On the other hand, this figure could be skewed by people who had an emergency and could not finish as expected.

4.User Rating
If a large sum of people who have completed a survey also decide to good feedback on a survey, this is a good side to others that this 
survey will satisfy them. Also, it would discourage people to take surveys that have a bad rating, thus incentivising survey makers to keep
a high standard.
